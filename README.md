## Overview

InterviewIQ is an AI-powered platform that empowers journalists by providing them with a comprehensive framework to conduct impactful interviews. Journalists can input key information and context about the interviewee and the topic, and InterviewIQ generates a tailored list of insightful and probing questions. The platform ensures that interviewers are well-prepared, equipped with relevant information, and able to ask thought-provoking questions that uncover the truth.

## Getting Started

MVP:

1. User Interface (UI): A functional and intuitive web-based interface for journalists to input interviewee details, topic context, and any specific parameters for the interview.

2. Question Generation: The AI-powered question generation system that analyzes the inputted information and generates a list of thought-provoking questions. The questions should be relevant, targeted, and designed to elicit informative responses.

3. Interview Preview: The ability for journalists to preview and customize the generated questions before conducting the interview. This allows them to fine-tune the list, add their own questions, or modify the sequence as needed.

4. Interviewee Profile Management: Basic functionality to manage interviewee profiles, including storing and retrieving information for future reference.

By delivering these core features, InterviewIQ's MVP showcases its key value proposition of assisting journalists in preparing impactful interviews and facilitating deeper insights from interviewees.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
